**DecisionsMaker** (English) and **SOPESA** (Español) is a premium decision-support application designed to bring clarity to complex choices. By combining the rigorous mathematics of the **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)** with a minimalist, "Apple-level" user experience, it transforms gut feelings into data-driven confidence.

## 🧠 The 'Why'

Most decisions are clouded by emotional noise and cognitive bias. DecisionsMaker uses **AHP**, a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions, developed by **Thomas L. Saaty** in the 1970s.

AHP works by:
1.  **Decomposing** the decision into a hierarchy of goals, criteria, and alternatives.
2.  **Pairwise Comparisons** to capture the relative importance of each element.
3.  **Synthesizing** these judgments into a mathematical priority vector.

By forcing a direct comparison between two options at a time, DecisionsMaker removes the overwhelm of "big picture" evaluation and reveals your true priorities.
